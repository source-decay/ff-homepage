## A Simple Startpage Built to enhance my Firefox Experience##

Recently, I have been a little annoyed with the directions in which Mozilla have been taking Firefox (among other things, the new tab page). As such, I have gone ahead and created a new tab page that has things available that I use and is a little more pleasant to look at IMO (because aesthetics trump usability, right?)

You can find my FireFox CSS right [here](https://gist.github.com/source-decay/e6fec3c3bbbdd06476b15dd4f35ddcb3)
